# PINN-Based Model Predictive Control with Laguerre Functions

This project presents an advanced approach to **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)** for multi-link manipulators by integrating **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with **Laguerre functions**. Our method aims to improve computational efficiency and control performance in trajectory tracking tasks.

## Overview

Building upon the foundational work detailed in [this repository](https://github.com/Jonas-Nicodemus/PINNs-based-MPC), which introduces PINNs into NMPC for multi-body dynamics, our project introduces several key enhancements:

- **Laguerre Function Integration:**  
  We employ **Laguerre functions** to parameterize control inputs, reducing the dimensionality of the control problem and enhancing computational efficiency.

- **Control and Prediction Horizons:**  
  By adjusting the **control horizon (Nu)** and **prediction horizon (Np)**, we achieve a balance between performance and computational load, tailoring the controller's responsiveness to specific application needs.

- **State Constraints:**  
  Incorporation of **explicit state constraints** ensures the system operates within safe and feasible boundaries, enhancing the reliability of the control strategy.

- **Realistic Disturbance Implementation:**  
  To improve realism, we introduce **a disturbance to the states received from the plant**. This simulates real-world uncertainties, allowing the controller to adapt to variations in system dynamics.

## üîç Key Differences from the Referenced Project

While the referenced project lays the groundwork for using PINNs in NMPC, our approach distinguishes itself through:

1. **Laguerre Function Application:**  
   The original project does **not** utilize Laguerre functions; our integration of these functions streamlines the control input parameterization, leading to improved computational performance.

2. **Dynamic Adjustment of Horizons:**  
   We explore various configurations of **prediction (Np) and control (Nu) horizons**, analyzing their impact on system performance and computational demands, whereas the original project maintains fixed horizons.

3. **Enhanced Constraint Handling:**  
   Our controller explicitly incorporates **state constraints**, ensuring adherence to safety and operational limits, a feature not emphasized in the original implementation.

4. **Disturbance Modeling in Simulation:**  
   Unlike the referenced work, we introduce **stochastic noise (disturbance) in the plant model** to simulate real-world uncertainties. This is implemented by adding Gaussian noise to the plant state outputs.
