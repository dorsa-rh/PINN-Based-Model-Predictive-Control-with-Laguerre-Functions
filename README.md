# PINN-Based-Model-Predictive-Control-with-Laguerre-Functions
This project presents an advanced approach to Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for multi-link manipulators by integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with Laguerre functions. This method aims to improve computational efficiency and control performance in trajectory tracking tasks.
